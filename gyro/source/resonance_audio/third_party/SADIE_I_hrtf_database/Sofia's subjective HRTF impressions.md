## Sofia's subjective HRTF impressions

Every face is different, so everyone's HRTF preference will be different. These impressions serve only to give an idea of what to listen for when you pick out an HRTF, but it is unlikely that your impressions will align with mine. For reference, I am a white, cisgender female. 

### Subject 001: Kemar Dummy Head
* +/- 60ish sounds like +/- 90 already
* upward elevation not convincing, but downward moreso and was able to accurately find 0 elevation
* (-90, 0) to (-90, 90) has some weird freq response pockets for me
* seems to go behind me around (-90, -45)
* much better than KU100

### Subject 002: Neumann KU100 Dummy Head
* everything at 0d elevation sounds a bit above my head
* strange HF flare near (180, 0)
* For elevation, feels mostly like up has more HF content, and down removes HF content. Having trouble localising.
* +/- 60ish sounds like +/- 90 already

### Subject 003: human
* much flatter freq resp in the front 
* +/- 80 sounds like 90
* up elevation is sounds less like a variable cutoff low pass 
* down elevation was great until about 45d, then there was a strange freq resp from (0 -45) to (0, -90)
* coronal plane is pretty convincing for up, but not at all for down. Down sounds like it's going up...

### Subject 004: human
* pretty good in transverse plane
* lose a lot of clarity above 60d elevation
* in coronal plane, on path from (90, 0) to (90, -90), goes behind me around (90, -45), at (90, 0) it sounds directly behind not directly below

### Subject 005: human
* pretty good in front of the tranverse plane, but when I move it to the back it seems to also go up
* although some strange Freq response on the way from (0,0) to (0, 90)
* elevation changes are noticeable, but sound more like filtering than changes in location
* coronal plane sounds good, able to place consistently

### Subject 006: human
* +/- 90 still sounds a bit behind me but on the whole happy with transverse plane
* elevation of 0 actually sounds like 0
* this is a darker (less bright) sound on the whole
* strange freq change around (0, 45) on the path from (0,0) to (0, 90). Not too convinced by upward elevation. Downward elevation is fine down to -45d but then stops being convincing. Again, super noticable, but sounds like a filter, not a change in location. 
* coronal plane for upward elevation is good
* coronal plane for downward: sound source seems to also move forward and back a bit along the path from (90, 0) to (90, -90)	

### Subject 007: human
* odd freq response in the front of the transverse plane
* sounds muted in general, especially in the back. Low perecived spatial resolution in the back. 
* already 40d sounds behind me! Then (40, 0) to (90, 0) sounds like it's coming back forward. Not a good fit. 
* nothing notable to say about elevation in sagittal plane
* having trouble with elevation in the coronal plane

### Subject 008: human
* 0 elevation sounds a little above me
* transverse plane is ok, 90 is only a little behind me, but still doesn't feel too compelling, hard to detect small movements.
* not too sensitive in the very front (+/- 20d). Usually I notice a lot of movement there but not for this one. Also not great in the back. 
* up elevation (sagittal) pretty good. Down elevation convincing until -60, where I hear strange freq resp
* coronal plane is doesn't work for me. Hardly hear a change.

### Subject 009: human
* good in transverse plane
* increased HF content from (-70, 0) to (-90, 0). This is what I consider a strange freq response pocket. 
* elevation seems too low passed at the top
* downward elevation sounds like a filter, having trouble localising
* in coronal plane, sound source seems to go behind me on the way up from (90, 0) to (90, 90) and in front on the way down from (90, 0) to (90, -90).

### Subject 010: human
* (60, 0) sounds like (90, 0)
* getting finer perceived resolution in the front again
* 0 elevation sounds a bit above
* some strange freq response and level from (90, 0) to (90, 90). Doesn't really sound like it's going up until 30-40d. 

### Subject 011: human
* best transverse plane so far. Good resolution and accuracy.
* although some weirdness between (70, 0) and (90, 0)
* upward elevation not convinving due to strange dip in freq response around (0, 45) and then gets much brighter above that. Downward elevation also not convincing.
* Coronal plane is great on the way up but doesn't fit so well on the way down

### Subject 012: human
* pretty good accuracy in transverse plane 
* bit of HF flare in the back
* upward elevation localisation is ok (does sound like change in location not just a filter) but pretty subtle. Downward elevation less convincing
