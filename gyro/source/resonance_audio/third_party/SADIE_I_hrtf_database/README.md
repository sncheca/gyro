The measurements come from the SADIE-I HRTF database, which can be downloaded directly from [here](https://www.york.ac.uk/sadie-project/database_old.html). 

Inside the [`WAV`](WAV/) directory, there is a directory for each subject. Subjects 1 and 2 are dummy heads, a KEMAR and a Neumann KU100, respectively. Subjects 3-20 are human subjects. In each subject's directory, the `DFC/` directory contains the _diffuse field compensated_ Head-Related Impulse Resonses (HRIRs) for lots of different angles. The `SH/` directory contains the _spherically encoded_ HRIRS, or shhrirs. You can read more about the process of creating shhrirs several levels up at [`gyro/matlab/README.md`](../../../../../matlab/README.md)
