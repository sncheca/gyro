The demo input file `mc-raw-paraisso.wav` can be downloaded from [here](https://yalmust.yale.edu/gyro). This is because it is too large to be hosted for free by `git-lfs` when many users download it. 

This is a 30-channel file that has all the separate voices, before spatial processing. It is slightly modified (gentle compression / levels, plus packaging it into one file) from the mix that can be found at the [Cambridge Music Technology Free Multitrack Download Library](https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/). The song is called "Paraisso" by Jude Safirah. Thank you Jude.
