ISSUES:

nested repository??

TODO
0 work through more tutorials
0 build my own object from "scratch". Start with a modified hello world where the right inlet sets the message
0 will especially need to look at buffers ofc. And like signal DSP (control is simpler)
0 look through min.info~, read through the code referenced in GuideToAudio.md
0 figure out how to build projects and objects using Max (in the extras folder). Konrad will like that. 
0 figure out a cleaner way to do changes, like calling doc_update somewhere.
0 I'm a bit iffy on some of this syntax
