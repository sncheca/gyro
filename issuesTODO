ISSUES:

nested repository??

TODO
0 work through more tutorials
0 build my own object from "scratch". Start with a modified hello world where the right inlet sets the message
0 build a new package? Is this necessary yet?
0 will especially need to look at buffers ofc. And like signal DSP (control is simpler)
0 Konrad wants to be able to build from Xcode. Fix the build settings so he can do this.
0 look through min.info~, read through the code referenced in GuideToAudio.md
