This is a modified version of the [`resonance_audio`](https://github.com/resonance-audio/resonance-audio/tree/master/resonance_audio) directory within [`resonance-audio-master`](https://github.com/resonance-audio/resonance-audio). I've changed the file extensions in the `ambisonics/` directory from `*.cc` to `*.cpp`.  


Note that the `third_party/` directory was originally inside the top level `resonance-audio-master/` directory, but not this lower level one.
